# Introduction Feature Implementation

## Overview
The introduction feature shows a welcome screen to users when they open the app for the first time. After completing the introduction, users will be redirected to the login page, and the introduction will not be shown again on subsequent app launches.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Storage Service Updates
- Added `_hasSeenIntroductionKey` constant for storing introduction status
- Added `setHasSeenIntroduction(bool hasSeen)` method to mark introduction as seen
- Added `hasSeenIntroduction()` method to check if user has seen introduction
- Added `resetIntroductionStatus()` method for testing purposes

### 2. Router Configuration
- Updated `routerProvider()` to check introduction status
- If user has seen introduction: redirects to login page
- If user hasn't seen introduction: shows introduction page

### 3. Introduction Page Updates
- Updated `_onIntroEnd()` method to:
  - Mark introduction as seen in storage
  - Navigate to login page using GoRouter
- Added proper imports for storage service and GoRouter

## How It Works

1. **First Launch**: When user opens the app for the first time, `hasSeenIntroduction()` returns `false`, so the app shows the introduction page
2. **Introduction Completion**: When user taps the "Начать" (Start) button, the app:
   - Calls `setHasSeenIntroduction(true)` to mark introduction as seen
   - Navigates to the login page
3. **Subsequent Launches**: On future app launches, `hasSeenIntroduction()` returns `true`, so the app directly shows the login page

## Testing the Feature

### To Test First-Time Launch:
1. Clear app data or uninstall/reinstall the app
2. Launch the app
3. You should see the introduction page with 3 slides
4. Tap "Начать" to complete the introduction
5. You should be redirected to the login page

### To Test Subsequent Launches:
1. After completing the introduction, close the app
2. Reopen the app
3. You should go directly to the login page (no introduction)

### To Reset Introduction Status (for testing):
```dart
final storageService = StorageServiceImpl();
await storageService.resetIntroductionStatus();
```

## Files Modified

1. `lib/src/core/services/storage/storage_service.dart` - Added interface methods
2. `lib/src/core/services/storage/storage_service_impl.dart` - Added implementation
3. `lib/src/core/router/router.dart` - Updated router logic
4. `lib/src/features/introduction/presentation/introduction_page.dart` - Updated completion logic

## Localization
The "Start" button uses the localized key `start` which translates to:
- English: "Начать" (currently showing Russian text)
- Russian: "Начать"

To update the English translation, modify `lib/src/core/localization/intl/intl_en.arb`:
```json
"start": "Start"
```
